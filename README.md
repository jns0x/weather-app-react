Application features:
- Displays a list of cities (for example polish capitals of voivodeships) and current temperature, humidity and percentage of clouds for each one of them.

- The list should be updated with most current info each X minutes (should be parametrised in some way).
```
  //TODO weather updating to be adjusted
```
- You can use any weather API available on the web to query (e.g. https://openweathermap.org/) - if you find something else, feel free to use it

- The list should provide filtering options to order by temperature, by humidity and percentage of clouds (from highest to lowest and vice versa)

- You should use Redux to keep the current state of the application and dispatch actions.

- The code should be kept in Git and stored in a remote repo (to choose - GitHub, bitbucket etc.)

- There should be a README.md file, explaining how to set up the environment and run the app.
